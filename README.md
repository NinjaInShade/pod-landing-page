## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties/vars
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

For this challenge, I practiced a lot of relative positioning, and getting a pixel-perfect design. I learnt how to use the "srcset" attribute where you have multiple of the same images at different widths for different screen sizes, to make it more easily responsive. I did know about it, but never actually used it before properly. Was very fun.

Overall, I really liked the design and green theme, reminded me of spotify a little bit. Hope you like this challenge :D
